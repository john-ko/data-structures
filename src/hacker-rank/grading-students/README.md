# grading students

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a _grade_ in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any _grade_ less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

- If the difference between the _grade_ and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round _grade_ up to the next multiple of 5.
- If the value of _grade_ is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

## examples
- _grade_ = 84 round to (85 - 84 is less than 3)
- _grade_ = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
- _grade_ = 57 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
