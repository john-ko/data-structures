# Datastructures
mainly playing around with datastructures, algorithms, and unit tests

## BST
- todo finish up

## Hashmaps
- does the index + 1 on collisions
- todo link list collisions?

## Fibnoacci
- O(1) implementation (limitations due to float percision truncation) but works until 75th fib sequence
- recursive
- iterative
- memoized
